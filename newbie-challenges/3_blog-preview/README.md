## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive design

### What I learned

- A better use of the propertie of `max-width`
- A better use of the propertie of `@media`

### Continued development

* Semantic structures with HTML5
* I need more practice with CSS Grid and CSS Flex for future projects
* In Responsive design
